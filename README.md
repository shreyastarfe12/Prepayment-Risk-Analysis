## Introduction

Understanding mortgage trends and predicting outcomes can significantly benefit various stakeholders in the housing market. This project leverages historical mortgage data to build predictive models that help in:
- Predicting mortgage approval chances based on applicant profiles.
- Estimating interest rates for different loan scenarios.
- Analyzing factors influencing mortgage default rates.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes anonymized historical mortgage data with features such as:
- Applicant information (age, income, credit score, employment status)
- Loan details (loan amount, interest rate, term)
- Property information (location, type, value)
- Mortgage approval status
